            <p>
              Our organization is committed to providing an ongoing presence in the community, granting access to the
              arts,
              as well as the stability of consistent after-school activity and a creative outlet for children, and
              adults of
              all ages.
            </p>
            <p>
              A program in the performing arts fosters a strong technical foundation, critical thinking, physical
              strength
              and flexibility, as well as emotional maturity and valuable interpersonal social skills. Our goal is to
              provide an entrance to the arts to both youth and adults, and seniors in our community and deliver ongoing
              support in experiencing and participating in the performing arts. Local youth involved in our program
              develop
              important social ties and participate in creating and maintaining a safe space for themselves and their
              peers.
              Friendships developed here will last a lifetime. </p>

            <p>Produced for "Light Up the Cathedral" and San Diego Pride
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2018, San Diego Creative Arts Project was proud to be asked to perform for "Light Up the Cathedral" for
              SD Pride. This event is an interfaith event including leaders from around the world of many different
              religious beliefs and was broadcast. The performance created and directed by SDCAP Artistic Director,
              Laura
              Hodge, included Contemporary Dance to the Cathedral's renowned live organ, Spoken Word, and a Vocal
              Performance by SDCAP and students.
            </p>
            <p>
              When asked to make a video for this year's event, with the prompts to include the theme, dance, and
              children
              and youth, Laura Hodge decided this was an opportunity to do something she has been wanting to do.
              Collaborate across the country with former colleagues and long time friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              This collaboration includes Laura, along with Tome Cousin - Pittsburgh, Pa, Mami Tomatani - New York City,
              John Diaz, San Diego, CA, and Samuel "Quin" Blesoe - San Diego, CA. The children are Laura's SDCAP
              students,
              and students of Mami at Hariyama Ballet, NY.

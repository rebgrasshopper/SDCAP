        <h3>SAN DIEGO CREATIVE ARTS PROJECT</h3>
        <h4>"Where Arts Emerge!"</h5>
        
        <h3>MISSION</h3>
        <p>
          Our organization is committed to providing an ongoing presence in the community, granting access to the arts,
          as well as the stability of consistent after-school activity and a creative outlet for children, and adults of
          all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          A program in the performing arts fosters a strong technical foundation, critical thinking, physical strength
          and flexibility, as well as emotional maturity and valuable interpersonal social skills. Our goal is to
          provide an entrance to the arts to both youth and adults, and seniors in our community and deliver ongoing
          support in experiencing and participating in the performing arts. Local youth involved in our program develop
          important social ties and participate in creating and maintaining a safe space for themselves and their peers.
          Friendships developed here will last a lifetime. </p>

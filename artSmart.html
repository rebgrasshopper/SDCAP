                        <p>Arts and culture enhance all lives. Recent studies have shown that students involved in the arts are more likely to be recognized for academic achievement.</p>
                        <p>Low-income students who are highly engaged in the arts are twice as likely to graduate college as their peers with no arts education.</p>
                        <p>The arts are recognized as a core academic subject under the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and 49 states have adopted standards for learning in the arts.</p>
                        <p>The act of performing can help students and youth recognize their potential for success and improve their confidence. Students who participate in arts learning experiences -often improve their achievement in other realms of learning
                            and life. All students benefit from the opportunity to learn about and experience the arts. Study of the arts — whether as a stand-alone subject or integrated into the school curriculum — is an essential part of achieving success
                            in school, work and life.</p>

                                This class will introduce students to the history of Hip-Hop culture with basic moves. The style encompasses the movements of break-dancing and body- popping with a concentration on footwork. The focus of this class is to build a solid foundation to execute
                                popular dance moves to original choreography. Warm up includes isolations, hard- hitting exercises, and a breakdown of the highly energetic routine to build stamina and increase musicality.

                                Did you know that social dancing improves physical coordination, strengthens muscles, improves posture and flexibility, and creates social connections? Students learn respect and tradition in a positive, non-judgmental and courteous manner. To each other,
                                students say please and thank you, curtsy and bow, and walk arm and arm in escort position into and from the class. As students often change dance partners, their ability to relate to one another and to respect their differences
                                is strengthened.

                                Participation in a drama class, has been proven as a source for gains in reading proficiency, improvement in self-concept and motivation, and higher levels of empathy and tolerance towards others among youth of all levels of socio-economic status. Drama
                                activities help to maintain social and language skills. Improvisational drama and games help students to open up and express themselves with their peers, and challenge them to quickly and creatively come up with solutions
                                to the moment. The skills developed through theater, not only train you how to convincingly deliver a message, but also build the confidence you need to take command of the stage.

                                Creating spoken-word is more than just memorizing or understanding. It’s asking youth to think critically. It helps improve students as readers and writers, their critical thinking and analysis, their self-confidence, and their literacy skills. Teaching
                                poetry is like pouring content into the students. Spoken-word allows kids to get problems down on a page, to share them verbally, and to get rid of that background noise from technology, and everyday life. Students will
                                write from life experience - speaking from the heart. They will form a poem and then share it with their peers. This strengthens the bond of the class as team and community.

                                Students will sing and learn music together, where the emphasis is on participation. The climate of the classroom and attitudes shift dramatically. Students find they are not only participating in singing but they are actually enjoying it. As students
                                begin to read music, the addition of music theory helps students understand what and why they are singing, and appreciate the musicality and how the notes create music.

                                Visual arts educators develop visual–spatial abilities, reflection, and experimentation. Visual arts education ensures that all young people become knowledgeable and skillful in the visual age. In addition to developing students’ intellectual capabilities,
                                visual arts instruction also helps develop young people’s sense of civic engagement. The arts stimulate or release imagination by bringing into existence an alternative reality. Students will be engaged in discussion about
                                the elements of art, such as content, composition, style, method and materials, with a focus on their life and sense of community.

                                Yoga and mindfulness have been shown to improve both physical and mental health in school-age children. Yoga improves balance, strength, endurance, and aerobic capacity in children. Yoga and mindfulness offer psychological benefits for children as well.
                                Research has shown that yoga can improve focus, memory, self-esteem, academic performance, and classroom behavior, and can even reduce anxiety and stress in children. In these yoga classes, fun games and stories will be
                                woven with positive themes like compassion, gratitude, and strength.

                                    versions of classic tales, set with modern, artistic, settings, and pop-rock music from the 80’s, 90’s, and current. For instance, the setting of Cinderella’s household uses scenery in the style of German expressionism,
                                    and then the Ball where she meets the prince turns into a scene resembling a Bollywood musical.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2018, San Diego Creative Arts Project was proud to be asked to perform for "Light Up the
                            Cathedral" for SD Pride. This event is an interfaith event including leaders from around the
                            world of many different religious beliefs and was broadcast. The performance
                            created and directed by SDCAP Artistic Director, Laura Hodge, included Contemporary Dance to
                            the Cathedral's renowned live organ, Spoken Word, and a Vocal Performance by SDCAP and
                            students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When asked to make a video for this year's event, with the prompts to include the theme,
                            dance, and children and youth, Laura Hodge decided this was an opportunity to do something
                            she has been wanting to do. Collaborate across the country with former
                            colleagues and long time friends.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This collaboration includes Laura, along with Tome Cousin - Pittsburgh, Pa, Mami Tomatani -
                            New York City, John Diaz, San Diego, CA, and Samuel "Quin" Blesoe - San Diego, CA. The
                            children are Laura's SDCAP students, and students of Mami at Hariyama Ballet,
                            NY.

                                with differing cultural models of body attitudes,
                                awareness, alignment, and the process of navigating in the world have led to
                                understanding functions of inner imagery, it's effects on the body, and the body's place
                                in the world. John’s hope is to facilitate the stability,
                                adaptability, radiance, grace, and directness inherent in everyone through movement
                                education and dance performance.</p>
